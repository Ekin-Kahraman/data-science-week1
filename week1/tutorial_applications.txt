TUTORIAL 1: CHECKING STRINGS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any string-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): 1, 2, 3
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 4


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [x] str_to_lower() - standardize capitalization
   [ ] str_to_upper() - standardize capitalization  
   [x] str_trim() - remove leading/trailing whitespace
   [x] str_replace() - fix typos or inconsistent spellings
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: site
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - Site_A
   - Site A
   - site_a
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - site_a
   - site_a
   - site_a


   Variable name: treatment
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - Control
   - control
   - HIGH_DOSE
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - control
   - control
   - high_dose


   Variable name: collector
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - Garci
   - Smyth
   - Garcia
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - Garcia
   - Smith
   - Garcia


4. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not? (Check all that apply)
   N/A - this tutorial is relevant

TUTORIAL 2: CHECKING DATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x] I completed the tutorial exercises



CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any date-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): 5
   [ ] NO - Skip to question 5


2. If YES, which technique from this tutorial could help address my question?

   [ ] dmy() / ymd() / mdy() - parse dates in different formats
   [ ] excel_numeric_to_date() - convert Excel serial numbers
   [x] Checking for impossible dates (wrong day/month/year)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   [ ] None of these apply


3. Show what this technique would DO to my data:

   Variable name: collection_date
   
   Example values BEFORE:
   - 2024-01-15
   
   What they would become AFTER:
   - NA (flagged as outside study period May-August 2023)


4. Think about consequences:

   What assumption am I making about date format?
   The dates are already parsed as YYYY-MM-DD by read_csv so format is not an issue.
   
   What could go wrong if this assumption is incorrect?
   If the date was entered wrong (e.g. meant 2023-01-15) then converting to NA loses information that could be recovered.
   
   How could I verify my assumption is correct?
   Check with the data collector whether 2024-01-15 is a typo for a 2023 date.


5. If this tutorial is NOT relevant to my data:

   Why not?
   N/A - this tutorial is relevant

TUTORIAL 3: CHECKING MISSING DATA PATTERNS - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any missing data questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): 3
   [ ] NO - But I'll check anyway (missing data is common)


2. Which variables have the most missing data?

   Variable: eggs_hatched | Percent missing: 8.3%
   Variable: eggs_laid | Percent missing: 7.8%
   Variable: body_mass_mg | Percent missing: 7.3%


3. Missingness types checklist

   [x] MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) - appears random/scattered
   [ ] MAR (Missing At Random) - related to other observed variables
   [ ] MNAR (Missing Not At Random) - related to the missing value itself

Why is it important to know what type of missing data we have?
It determines how we can handle it. If MCAR, we can remove rows without biasing results. If MAR or MNAR, removing rows could bias the analysis. I would need to check whether missingness is related to treatment or site before deciding.

TUTORIAL 4: CHECKING DUPLICATES - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x] I completed the tutorial exercises


CONNECTING TO MY DATA:
----------------------

1. Did I identify any duplicate-related questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [x] NO - But I'll check anyway


3. Think about consequences:

   If I remove duplicates, what am I assuming?
   That the duplicate rows are errors and not legitimate repeated observations of the same female.
   
   If duplicates are actually repeated measures, what should I do instead?
   [x] Keep them - they're legitimate observations
   [x] Flag them for later analysis that accounts for non-independence
   [ ] Other: ___________
   The metadata says female_id should be unique unless repeated measures from weekly sampling, so duplicates in female_id could be legitimate.

================================================================================
TUTORIAL 5: NUMERIC & CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY - APPLICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

[x] I completed the tutorial exercises


PART A: NUMERIC PLAUSIBILITY
-----------------------------

1. Did I identify any numeric plausibility questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [x] YES - Question #(s): 4
   [ ] NO - Skip to Part B


2. If YES, which numeric variable looks suspicious?

   Variable name: body_mass_mg
   
   Minimum value: -93.0  | Is this biologically possible? [ ] Yes [x] No [ ] Unsure
   Maximum value: 108.7  | Is this biologically possible? [x] Yes [ ] No [ ] Unsure
   

   Why do these look wrong?
   [x] Negative value (impossible for this measurement)
   [ ] Zero (should be NA instead)
   [ ] Too large (exceeds known biological maximum)
   [ ] Too small (below known biological minimum)
   [ ] Possible units confusion (mixed kg and g?)
   [ ] Other: ___________



PART B: CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY
-----------------------------------

4. Did I identify any cross-variable questions in my Week 1 questions list?

   [ ] YES - Question #(s): ___________
   [x] NO - But I'll check anyway


5. Choose TWO variables that should be related:

   Variable 1: body_mass_mg
   Variable 2: eggs_laid
   
   What relationship do I expect between them?
   [x] Positive correlation (both increase together)
   [ ] Negative correlation (one increases, other decreases)
   [ ] Biological constraint (certain combinations impossible)
   [ ] Spatial constraint (certain combinations shouldn't occur)
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Describe the expected relationship:
   Larger females should have more resources to produce eggs, so higher body mass should correlate with more eggs laid.


6. Think about consequences:

   If these variables are inconsistent, what should I do?
   [ ] Remove the observations
   [x] Convert one variable to NA (which one? body_mass_mg)
   [ ] Flag for review but keep both
   [ ] Query the data collector
   [ ] Other: ___________
   
   Justification:
   If body mass is negative it is clearly an error so converting to NA preserves the other data for that observation.
